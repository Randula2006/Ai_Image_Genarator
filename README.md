# Ai_Image_Genarator
Custom portfolio made up with React JS to increase the capability and use it in the web as an application and also have the capability to give any text through openai's api and view the result image and can download from it.




Also you have to download the react app through npx create-react-app application_name and get the required node modules 
because github dosen't support node moduludes to be included. 

cheers bois.
